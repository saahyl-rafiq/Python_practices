They were super friendly and any time we had an issue with our apartment, the landlords had someone in to fix it withing a day or two. The kitchen appliances are in great condition and the building is clean. The only reason we moved was to get a dog!"], "review_date": ["January 14, 2014"]},

Could hear pipes rattling and the neighbors upstairs and the old manager, there's a great guy there now, was truely miserable. Great locations though. Right on bus line near food and university campus. Cute apt, not accessible for wheelchairs but livable. Good square footage space for Minneapolis price, nice balcony window but no balcony. Laundry room pricey and not many machines."], "review_date": ["December 25, 2013"]},

They squeak and creak to almost intolerable levels. Other than that, this is a great apartment for a fair price."], "review_date": ["December 25, 2013"]},

{"username": ["New Boston Square Apartments Resident"], "user_rating": ["1"], "user_review": ["NOT worth the money. While the list goes on and on, I will highlight a few experiences I had while living here. First, the management is very lazy. They refuse or barely fix appliances in the apartment (i.e. Our A/C wasn't operational for nearly 3 months before they fixed it - one night, it was 97 degrees in our apartment and the management told us that we should expect that temperature on warm nights). Don't waste your money here. It just isn't worth it! We moved downtown MLPS for cheaper! B..."], "review_date": ["December 15, 2013"]}]
