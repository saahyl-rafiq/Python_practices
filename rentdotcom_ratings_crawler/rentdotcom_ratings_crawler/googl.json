If someone walks by, we hold our dog(s) until the pass, otherwise they just stay with us and play. One of us has been fined $50 for letting the dogs off their leashes. \n\n*The pavilion and playground are is rarely used and is a waste but intend of making if better for residents with animals, they leave it there. \n\n*The maintenance takes forever to go through so you are better off fixing things yourself. \n\n*In order to contact the office, you have to go through a call center and leave a message, then hope that the office will call you back. They almost never do. \n\nI highly suggest finding somewhere else. There are many other places out there with better pricing and better benefits to living there. Also, if you have a pet or a kid, don't even dream of getting your security deposit back. The entire place has white carpets and white walls.\n\nThe only pro about living here is the area. It is right off of McKnight Rd and and Babcock Rd everything is very close by. There is a community behind Governor's Ridge called McKnight Village that is really nice. Very little cars travel through there so walking and running around is nice. There is a community park up there you can take your dogs to but it isn't fenced in and is used during baseball/softball seasons."], "review_date": ["3 years ago"]}]
